A webshop app using the public Punk REST API to query the beer selection of Scottish brewing company BrewDog.
(NOTE: I have no affiliation with BrewDog and the API is not official).

Stack:

React, Redux (Redux Toolkit), React Router, SASS.

Uses `react-paypal-button` and `react-stripe-checkout` for mock payment popups.

This is a work in progress, I'm continuously improving the app. Next steps: Login using Google Auth + possible Firebase integration.
