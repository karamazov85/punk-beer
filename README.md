A webshop app using the public Punk API to query the beer selection of Scottish brewing company BrewDog.
(NOTE: I have no affiliation with BrewDog and the API is not official).

##Stack:

React, Redux (Redux Toolkit), React Router, SASS.

Uses `react-paypal-button` and `react-stripe-cehckout` for mock payment popups.
